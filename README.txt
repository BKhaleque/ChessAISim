This is the source code to go along with my final project. I tried making an executable .jar file however double clicking it resulted in no response
so it has to be run from the terminal instead

To run follow these steps:

1. Open the terminal

2. CD into the src directory for the project

3. Use the command 'javac Main.java' in the terminal

4. Use the command 'Java Main'

5. Enter the amount of generations you would like to evolve for.

6. Enter the size of the initial population. If you want a randomly generated game put 0 for both the generations and initial population.

7. Keep the program running until a game is generated. This will take a while.

8. Play your generated game!
